# Generating-Random-Integers.

This program is a simple script that generates a random integer between 1 and 100 using the random module.

## Description
This code is a simple program that generates a random integer between 1 and 100 using the random module. The program starts by importing the random module, which provides functionality for generating random numbers. Then, it uses a for loop to iterate through the range 1. Inside the for loop, it uses the randint() function from the random module to generate a random integer between 1 and 100, and then prints the randomly generated number. This program will only print one random number between 1 and 100 every time it's executed.


## Installation
This program does not require any installation. Simply copy and paste the code into a Python IDE or text editor and run the program.

## Usage
1.	Run the program
2.	The program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100.
